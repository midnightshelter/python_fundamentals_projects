# Program prompts user for input of a string, checks for a "g" inside the string. If "g" is present,
# the function "gchecker" runs several cascading if and elif statements determining if another "g"
# is present within 1 position (positively and negatively). If so, "Happy?: True" is printed.
# If not, "Happy?: False" is printed.


# The below function first checks that the input string is long enough to allow two "g"'s to exist.
# If not "Happy?: False" is printed immediately. If the string is longer than two, the function
# runs through a cascading set of if and elif statements to test if another "g" exists within 1
# position of the original "g"'s index.
