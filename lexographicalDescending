# Program allows user to input strings until no "" (or "no input") is entered. When string is input
# entire string is converted to lowercase, sorted into lexicographical order and flipped, to be
# output in descending lexicographical order.

# Below loop checks the variable "inputCheck" to ensure that the break condition has not been met
# (break condition = no input), if not the loop prompts the user for a string, converts it to lower-
# case, then to a list, sorts the list and then reverses it, printing in descending lexicographical
# order. If break condition is met, the loop is stopped with a break call.
